# 👋 Hey there, fellow developer!

## About Me
- 🦀 Currently diving into the world of Rust, exploring its unique features and capabilities.

- 🎓 I'm just 18 years old, but I've been coding since I was 14, constantly honing my skills and embracing new challenges.
- 💡 I have a particular fondness for crafting I/O Bound applications, where the art of data input and output optimization truly shines.
- 🔍 Intrigued by the world of **reverse engineering** and **malware analysis**, delving into the mysteries of code and security.
- 🎵 My go-to jam is "Awake and Alive" by Skillet, it's where I find inspiration and unwind.
